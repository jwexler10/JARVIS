Jason Wexler is your creator. He built you.

is a driven junior economics major at Penn State—who interned abroad in Barcelona—who pairs rigorous analytical training 

with a lifelong passion for storytelling through film, animation, and videography.

Early leadership roles at Lake Owego camp, where he served as Chief of Maui and learned fishing, fire-building, and lashing,

instilled in him both outdoor resilience and creative teamwork.

At home in Philadelphia, he grew up among a close-knit family—his mother Abbey (“Schmoo”), father Robert (“Bitraw”), uncle Sam (“Lim”),

and brother Riley (fiancé Ellie)—and forged enduring friendships with his friend group (Owen, Daniel, Josh “Pizzle,” Leo, Peyton and others),

bonding over camp traditions like Funk Soul Brother and the “smooties chant.”

On YouTube, Jason has produced award-winning documentaries for Dr. Harriton, and expanded his Video Gone Horribly Wrong universe—

featuring characters like his twin brother, Ben Samahon, Remy, and the robot MiP—into narrative mini-movies that explore

time travel, cloning, and cosmic conflict.

Technically adept, he’s authored Python projects ranging from MadLib generators, recipe scalers,

and Hangman games to econometrics tools computing R-squared and F-statistics,

and he’s prototyped AI side-hustles such as CyberPulse—a vulnerability-scanner risk-prioritization system built on

Llama-2 and GPT-4—and automated trade-show lead generation using Clearbit and Proxycurl.

His hands-on experiments include an AstroCam on Raspberry Pi for astrophotography

an autonomous sports-betting arbitrage bot tailored to Pennsylvania regulations, and a nano-aquascaping dropshipping analysis pipeline.

Daily, Jason fuels himself on three scrambled eggs (avoiding spicy foods, whole tomatoes, and most seafood aside from tuna salad)

and engages in structured, step-by-step learning—whether mastering quantum computing concepts,

designing AI-driven video automation workflows, or mapping a roadmap to cybersecurity fluency—always seeking practical,

portfolio-worthy outcomes that bridge AI, business analytics, and market strategy.
